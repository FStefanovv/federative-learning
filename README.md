<h2>Federative learning for smoking classification</h2>

This project utilizes federative learning for distributed and decentralized neural network training for determining whether a person is a smoker or non-smoker based on various health related data. 
The neural network training is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, while Python Flask was used for exposing the training API. <br>
The aggregation of results from individual nodes and calculation of the weights of the global model were achieved using FedAvg algorithm implemented in Golang.
